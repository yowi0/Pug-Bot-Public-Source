# Pug-Bot-Public-Source
A very basic source of one of my first bots.

This bot haves the next funtions:

p/pug: Sends you a random pug picture.

p/meme: Sends you a random meme.

p/play: You can play any music from YouTube with that command in a voice channel.

p/skip: Skip the song that is playing the bot.

p/stop: Stop all the songs in queue.

p/slap: Slap a user from your server.

p/ping: See you ping.

p/ban: Ban a user from your server.

p/kick: Kick a user from your server.

p/discord: Official discord from the bot.

p/invite: Sends you the invite from the bot.

And that's all, I hope you to be useful that source for you.
